Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The client was The Gaming Room. They currently had a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software functionality and expand to other platforms.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
my process was keeping focus on the task at hand and deciding on what tasks were important and which ones weren’t urgent.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick Recommendations. Being able to put the recommendation clearly and concisely while keeping it understandable for non tech-savvy people proved to be a challenge. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the functionality of the game and helped split it up so that there would be less work and time spent expanding to other operating platforms. All while keeping the game the same. 
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I put my focus on clear documentation and separating the game and the game needs the functionality to allow easier updates and maintenance.
